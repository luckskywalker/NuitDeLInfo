Our goal was to create an innovating tool to help refugees to find the others members of their family in refugee camp. For ease of access, we planned to do as web page. But since our work environment wasn't set up for it, we lost much time in the first hours, and we was forced to change our ideas.
So we tried to make a website of diseases information for prevention and first information if you're ill. But we tried to give as much as possible ease of access for keyboard only computer.
That was the challenge we tried to record. To navigate on the website, you just have to hit the Key on green background.
